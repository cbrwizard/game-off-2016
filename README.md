# What

A game about Elon trying to colonize Mars!

This game is more than 9000% about the Github's game-off topic.

It's about augmenting. It is the first game in the world which uses an innovative IR: Imagination Reality(tm)! Since the visual assets are mostly missing, the players have to use Imagination in order to fully experience the game. This is much better than VR, since no dizziness is included!

It's about hacking. This game is filled with bugs at the very interesting places. Players will never know what to expect! Players are encouraged to clone the game's source and fix the bugs by hacking through the code! Innovative!
